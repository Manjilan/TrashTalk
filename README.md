## About the Project

Problem Scope:
In 2016, Oakland Public Works collected nearly 29,000 piles of illegal trash. Over the last five years, the city has expierienced an 85% increase in illegal dumping activity. These sites negatively impact the health of the public, the integrity of the environment, and the strength of the local economy. 

Mission: Provide a medium for Oakland Residents to organize Cleanups of illegal dumping sites in their neighborhoods. 

Vision: Become a trusted tool Oaklanders use to foster a sense of community and an ownership of their local places.

Goals:
 1. Create a database which manages information on users and cleanups
 2. Protect user privacy by ensuring information is only used by those who need it, in order to serve the needs of the users. 
 3. Design a single-page site that can be used on both mobile and desktop
 4. Implement a feedback process to continually improve user experience accross diverse demographics
 5. Integrate with Public Works so they can support TrashTalk users with equipment and other government resources
